1. Let's send message on enter keyboard event - 02/28/2020
-- DONE. 
    - I had too do this using js interop. and the textbox is getting emptied after the message has been sent to the other user.

3. Let's figure out how we can use SQLite for storing our user information - 02/28/2020
-- DONE
    - I had to install SQLite extension to make it work and write queries in vs code. But I did not have to install SQLite to make this happen
So anyone from any machine cloning this project should be able to use the DB just fine.

4. Let's add twitter login in the server side app - 03/02/2020
-- DONE
    - The best way to do this is by creating keys by email address that you really do not care about?
    - Then people who are intended to bad things with the keys then they can and it's okay if I loose that email address
    - I created a new twitter app with my secrete email address 
    - I also added the consumer key and consumer secrete key to the app settings 
    - I added twitter package in the server project 
    - I added the configuration services at the time of start up
    - I had to add custom authentication state provider in order to handle twitter authentication
    - I had to clean and build the solution in order to make it recognize the <AuthorizeRouteView>

2. Figure out how you can add the message at the bottom of the table instead of adding at the top - 02/28/2020
-- DONE
    - I learned that we can do this is using justify content - flex but the outer div was not recognizing the inner div
    - We are going to convert a js query UI (that I found on internet) in Blazor UI

5. Also remove sub directories of directories that I want to ignore - 03/08/2020
-- DONE
    - I had to follow below steps in order to achieve this 
        1. Delete the folders that you don't want to commit in yout Git Repo
        2. Then commit the changes that you did 
        3. Then mention all those folders/files in you .gitignore file

7. Find out ways to pass objects through SignalR connection
-- DONE
    - We have to make changes on the "On" receive function
    - Send the object when you call SignalR send
    - Change the method signature at the server

8. Make the UI changes so that only logged in users can see the navmenu
-- DONE
    - I used layouts to achieve this
    - still need to find an image for the login page 

9. Upgrade the project Blzor WebAssembly 3.2 Preview 2
-- DONE
    - var builder = WebAssemblyHostBuilder.CreateDefault(args); was throwing an error after upgrading the references 
    - I had to change the namespace that I was using
    - UseWebAssemblyDebugging and UseBlazorFrameworkFiles were throwing an error 
    - because it wasn't mentioned to upgrade server references to 
    - <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Server" Version="3.2.0-preview2.20160.5" />
    - need to talk to Blazor team or comment on post for the challeneges that faced
