Challenges in upgrading from 3.2 Preview1 to 3.2 Preview2
    - var builder = WebAssemblyHostBuilder.CreateDefault(args); was throwing an error after upgrading the references 
    - I had to change the namespace that I was using
    - UseWebAssemblyDebugging and UseBlazorFrameworkFiles were throwing an error 
    - because it wasn't mentioned to upgrade server references to 
    - <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Server" Version="3.2.0-preview2.20160.5" />

    
I need to find a better VS Code extension for taking notes

 Blazor has its own input controls as components that add a bit more functionality i.e. <InputCheckbox>

 I am thinking of creating a new project with Blazor WenAssembly 3.2 Preview 2 and migrating Blazing Chat into it
    -> Authenticate using ASP.NET Core Identity and IdentityServer - there are using sqlite for storing the user information 
    -> Token-based authentication - I don't need to implement whole JWT authentication


Let's say I want to store the chat history
